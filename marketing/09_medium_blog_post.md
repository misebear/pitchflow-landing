# Is Your Singing Damaging Your Vocal Cords? How to Check for Free

*A guide to clinical-grade vocal health analysis on your phone*

---

If you're a singer — whether professional, aspiring, or just someone who loves karaoke — there's one question that probably nags at you:

**"Am I hurting my voice?"**

Vocal cord damage is notoriously difficult to detect early. By the time you notice hoarseness or pain, the damage might already be significant. ENT doctors use specialized equipment and software to detect problems early, but that's not exactly accessible for your daily practice sessions.

## The Metrics Your Doctor Uses

In voice science (known as **voice acoustics**), there are four key metrics that clinicians use to assess vocal health:

| Metric | What It Measures | Healthy Range |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Jitter** | Pitch instability (cycle-to-cycle variation) | <1% |
| **Shimmer** | Amplitude instability | <3% |
| **HNR** | Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio (voice clarity) | >20 dB |
| **CPP** | Cepstral Peak Prominence (voice quality) | Higher = better |

These are traditionally measured using **Praat**, a powerful but complex desktop software used by speech-language pathologists and voice researchers. It's free, but let's be honest — it has a learning curve steeper than a rock climbing wall.

## PitchFlow: Clinical Metrics on Your Phone

**PitchFlow** brings these four metrics to your Android phone in a format that actually makes sense.

Here's how it works:

1. Open the **Vocal Health Assessment** feature
2. Sustain a comfortable "ahhh" sound for 3+ seconds
3. Get instant results for Jitter, Shimmer, HNR, and CPP
4. Receive a comprehensive vocal health score

No medical degree required. No complex software to install. Just sing and get results.

## But Wait, There's More

PitchFlow isn't just about vocal health. It's a comprehensive vocal training toolkit:

### Real-time Pitch Detection
Using the **YIN algorithm** (the gold standard in academic pitch detection research), PitchFlow detects your pitch with millisecond precision. This is the same algorithm used in published voice research papers — not a basic FFT approach that most consumer apps use.

### AI Vocal Coaching
Get **30+ types of real-time feedback** while you sing. The AI analyzes your pitch accuracy, dynamics, tension, breath support, and more, giving you specific, actionable coaching tips as you practice.

### Vibrato Analysis
PitchFlow doesn't just tell you "good vibrato" — it shows you the actual **waveform of your vibrato**, letting you see the frequency and amplitude oscillation pattern. This is the kind of analysis that used to require studio equipment.

### Metronome & Ear Training
Build your rhythmic precision and develop your ear with built-in practice tools.

## Who Is This For?

- **Singers** who want to practice smart, not just hard
- **Voice students** preparing for exams or auditions
- **Karaoke enthusiasts** who want to improve
- **Anyone concerned** about vocal fatigue or damage
- **Voice teachers** looking for a student-friendly analysis tool

## The Price? Free.

No subscriptions. No premium tier. No ads forced down your throat.
