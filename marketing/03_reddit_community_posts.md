## 📌 r/singing — "I found a free app that checks vocal cord health"

**Title**: I found a free app that analyzes vocal health with clinical-grade metrics (Jitter, Shimmer, HNR) — no subscription needed

**Body**:

Hey everyone,

I've been looking for a way to track my vocal health without visiting a specialist every time, and I stumbled upon this app called PitchFlow.

What surprised me is that it provides **Jitter, Shimmer, HNR, and CPP analysis** — these are the exact same metrics that speech pathologists and ENT doctors use to assess voice quality. I had no idea a mobile app could do this.

Besides the vocal health stuff, it also has:
- Real-time pitch detection with a scrolling piano keyboard
- Vibrato waveform analysis
- AI coaching with 30+ feedback types
- Metronome and interval training

The pitch detection uses the YIN algorithm which is research-grade accuracy. I've been comparing it with my tuner and it's surprisingly precise.

It's free on Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pitchflow.vocal

Has anyone else tried vocal health tracking apps? Would love to hear your experience.

## 📌 r/androidapps — "Free vocal training app with clinical voice analysis"

**Title**: [DEV] PitchFlow — Free AI vocal training app with real-time pitch detection and vocal health assessment

**Body**:

Hey r/androidapps!

I wanted to share an app that combines vocal training with professional voice analysis.

**Key features:**
- 🎯 **Real-time pitch detection** using the YIN algorithm (research-grade accuracy)
- 🏥 **Vocal health assessment** — Jitter, Shimmer, HNR, CPP (the same metrics used in clinical settings)
- 🌊 **Vibrato analysis** with waveform visualization
- 🤖 **AI coaching** with 30+ personalized feedback types
- 🎵 Metronome, interval training, and recording/playback

**What makes it different:** Most singing apps just show you the note. PitchFlow goes deeper with vibrato waveform analysis and actual vocal cord health metrics that you'd normally only get from a speech therapist.

📲 Free on Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pitchflow.vocal

No ads in your face, no forced subscriptions on launch. Would love to hear your feedback!

## 📌 r/vocalcoach — "Tool for tracking vocal health between lessons"

**Title**: Found a useful tool for tracking vocal health metrics between lessons

**Body**:

For any vocal coaches or students here — I've been using PitchFlow to monitor voice quality between my lessons and it's been really helpful.

It measures:
- **Jitter** (pitch period perturbation) 
- **Shimmer** (amplitude perturbation)
- **HNR** (Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio)
- **CPP** (Cepstral Peak Prominence)

These are the standard clinical voice analysis parameters that speech pathologists use. Having them available on my phone between appointments has helped me notice patterns — like how my Shimmer increases when I'm tired or haven't hydrated enough.

The app also has real-time pitch tracking and AI coaching, but the vocal health feature is what really sets it apart.

Free on Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pitchflow.vocal

Would love to hear from any vocal professionals whether they find this kind of metric tracking useful for their students.

## 📌 한국 커뮤니티 — 에브리싱/디시 노래갤/보컬 커뮤니티

**제목**: 내 성대 건강을 무료로 체크할 수 있는 앱 발견함

**본문**:

노래 연습 많이 하시는 분들, 성대 관리 어떻게 하시나요?

최근에 PitchFlow라는 앱을 발견했는데, 병원에서 쓰는 음성분석 지표를 그대로 앱에서 보여줌.

- Jitter (음정 미세변동) 
- Shimmer (음량 미세변동)
- HNR (조화음 대 잡음 비율)
- CPP (켑스트럼 피크 돌출도)

이게 원래 Praat이라는 전문 소프트웨어에서만 볼 수 있는 건데 모바일로 무료로 해준다는 게 신기함.

그리고 실시간 음정 분석도 걸린데 YIN 알고리즘이라 정확도 괜찮고, AI가 실시간으로 30가지 피드백도 줌.

성대 많이 쓰는 분들은 한번 체크해보는 것도 좋을 듯.

안드로이드만 됨. 무료임.
